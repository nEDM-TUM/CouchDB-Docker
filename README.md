CouchDB-Docker
==============

Docker for CouchDB servers in the nEDM experiment.

## Information

This docker is based off of klaemo/couchdb:1.6.1 and includes a number of
scripts (os daemons and update notifiers) that need to be run in parallel.

The couchdb server which is run allows proxy authentication though with a
randomly defined private key (automatically generated for each container),
which means this is only used for the local scripts (os daemons/update
notifiers) that run in the container.

### Setup options

1. Mount lib directory (R/W) to `/usr/local/var/lib/couchdb`
1. Mount log directory (R/W) to `/usr/local/var/log/couchdb`
1. To define an admin user, export the environment variable for the hash
generated by CouchDB, i.e.: `-e "ADMINHASH=admin = -pbkdf2-0hashfollowshere"`
1. To define a private key that is always used by this server, export the environment variable `PRIVATE_KEY`, i.e.:
`-e "PRIVATE_KEY=private_key_to_use"`

### Example command

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v /local_path_to_lib/couchdb:/usr/local/var/lib/couchdb \
  -v /local_path_t_log/couchdb_log:/usr/local/var/log/couchdb \
  -e "ADMINHASH=admin = -pbkdf2-HASH_OF_ADMIN_LOGIN" \
  -e "PRIVATE_KEY=private_key_to_use" \
  --name nEDM-CouchDB \
  registry.hub.docker.com/mgmarino/couchdb-docker:latest
```

`-e` parts of the command are optional.  Note, if you want to test to see if the `couchdb` instance is running, you can export port `5984`: `-p 15984:5984` where the local port `15984` is used.

### Once running

There are a few options that have to be taken care of to setup for an nEDM
server:

#### Alarm Daemon

If you wish to run the alarm daemon, change `alarm_daemon:disabled` to be
`false` in the configuration.  Other configuration options:

```javascript
{
  email_agent : 'name.of.smtp.server', // name of SMTP server to send
                                       // notification emails
  emails : ['email@host.com', 'emailtwo@host.com'], // list of email addresses
													// that receive
													// notification
  disabled : true // don't run on this server
}
```

#### View Updater/Aggregator

This runs to update views as well as aggregates changes from `nedm/` databases

Options include:

```javascript
{
  write_aggregate : false, // Run aggregation (set to true to do this)
  checked_types   : ['data', 'heartbeat'], // Types of documents that are
										   // aggregated into the aggregate db
}
```
